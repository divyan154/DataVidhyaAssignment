## Challenges faced 
Initially, the accordion was built to allow only one question open at a time using a single activeIndex. This caused other questions to close when one was opened, which wasn't ideal.

Solution:
Replaced activeIndex with an array of activeIndexes to support multiple open items at once. This allowed users to view several answers simultaneously, improving the UX.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- *[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)* – Framework for building fast, scalable React apps
- *[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)* – For utility-first styling


> These technologies were chosen for their modern developer experience, community support, and ability to scale quickly.
